Game description and rules
Welcome to the Flip Card Game! This is a text_base game based on C++, your objective is to flip cards and match them. Each mode offers its own level of difficulty and challenges.

The operation method of the game is to use the "wasd" key for selection and flipping. 

If you want to pause the game during gameplay, you can press "q" to enter the pause menu. In the pause menu, you can choose to save the game and exit, continue the game, and restart.

You can test your memory and matching skills across different game modes: Endless, Challenge, and Custom, each game mode refers to different rules.
  1. Endless Mode: including easy mode and hard mode, 3 rounds will be included
      1. Easy Mode: Two cards can be flipped at once, larger table will be set in each new round, there are no move limit
      2. Hard Mode: Three cards can be flipped at once, larger table will be set in each new round, there are no move limit
  2. Challenge Mode: There will be a maximum move limit, there will be a shorter time interval between each flip
  3. Custom Mode: You can define your own table: its size and the number of cards to be flipped at once, there are no move limit
All of the instructions can be found in the tutorial part, you can check any time if you forget.


Game features and corresponding coding element



A list of features that you have implemented and explain how each coding element 1 to 5 listed under the coding requirements aforementioned support your features.



Generation of random game sets or events

Feature 1: Random numbers in each round
 1. The game incorporates random numbers to introduce unpredictability and variability in each round.
 2. The coding element of generating random game sets or events is utilized to achieve this feature.
 3. At the start of each round, the game generates random numbers using the coding element.
 4. These random numbers are used to determine various aspects of the game, such as shuffling the cards, determining the order of turns, or randomizing the positions of game elements.
 5. The randomization ensures that each round is unique and different from the previous ones.

Data structures for storing game status (e.g., arrays, STL containers)


Dynamic memory management (e.g., dynamic arrays, linked lists, STL containers)


File input/output (e.g., for loading/saving game status)


Program codes in multiple files (recall separate compilation)





▪ A list of non-standard C/C++ libraries, if any, that are used in your work and integrated to your code repo. 
Please also indicate what features in your game are supported by these libraries.








▪ Compilation and execution instructions. This serves like a "Quick start" of your game.
The teaching team will follow your instructions to compile and run your game
